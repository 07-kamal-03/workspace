Inheritance

-> inherit the properties from the parent class
-> inhert both functions and variables, don't want to rewrite in child class
-> extends keyword

types:

-> single=> A->B
-> multilevel=> A->B->C

                  --->B
                  |
-> hierarchical=> A
                  |
                  --->C

-> multiple A-->|
                C  using class is not possible so using interface to possible A,B - interface && C- class
            B-->|

Advantages:
-> code reusability
