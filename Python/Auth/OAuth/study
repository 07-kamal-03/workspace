resource owner - client(insta) - gmail authorization server - gmail server

1. client register with GMAS - response from GMAS [client id, client secret key]
2. resource owner(user) tap sign in / sign up in client then client redirect with GMAS and
    request Auth code, in GMAS login using gmail and give consent (client can use my data)
3. GMAS provide the Auth code
4. Using Auth code the client request for the Token
5. GMAS provide the token (time limit) with refresh token (if the token expired using refresh token to regenerate the new token (one time limit & refresh token again))
6. the client using the token request for the user data to the Gmail server
7. the Gmail server validate with GMAS (token valid / invalid)
8. if valid Gmail server provide the data to the client / invalid return the not valid (error)
9. client successfully login / failed


types:
1. implicit grant - without auth code step directly request to get the token (don't have refresh token)
2. Resource owner credentials grant - using the users username and password directly to get the token (has refresh token)
3. client credential grant - user and client both are same, using client id and client secret to get the token (don't have refresh token)
